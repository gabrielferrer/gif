The Compression Algorithm

Routine LZW_COMPRESS

PLAIN TEXT

CODE:

   1. STRING = get input character
   2. WHILE there are still input characters DO
   3.	CHARACTER = get input character
   4.	IF STRING+CHARACTER is in the string table then
   5.		STRING = STRING+character
   6.	ELSE
   7.		output the code for STRING
   8.		add STRING+CHARACTER to the string table
   9.		STRING = CHARACTER
  10.	END of IF
  11.	END of WHILE
  12.	output the code for STRING

The Modified Decompression Algorithm

Routine LZW_DECOMPRESS

PLAIN TEXT

CODE:

   1. Read OLD_CODE
   2. output OLD_CODE
   3. CHARACTER = OLD_CODE
   4. WHILE there are still input characters DO
   5.	Read NEW_CODE
   6.	IF NEW_CODE is not in the translation table THEN
   7.		STRING = get translation of OLD_CODE
   8.		STRING = STRING+CHARACTER
   9. 	ELSE
  10.		STRING = get translation of NEW_CODE
  11.	END of IF
  12.	output STRING
  13.	CHARACTER = first character in STRING
  14.	add OLD_CODE + CHARACTER to the translation table
  15.	OLD_CODE = NEW_CODE
  16. END of WHILE
